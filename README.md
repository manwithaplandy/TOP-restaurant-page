# TOP-restaurant-page
Using NPM and Webpack for The Odin Project

Using the skills to make a Single Page App for this fake restaurant. This restaurant does not want you to dine there. It is, in fact, a front for the mob.

Also I didn't worry too much about polishing it since it was more about practicing webpack and ES6 import/exports. 

gh-pages is the branch hosted on Github pages.
